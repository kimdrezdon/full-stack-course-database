# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

This full stack application uses React and a REST API to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. 
Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating or deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the app requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
