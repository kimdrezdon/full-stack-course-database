# Full Stack Course Database

### Techdegree Project 9 & 10

This full stack application uses React and a REST API built using Sequelize, Express, Node.js and JavaScript to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses.
Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating or deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the app requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
Navigation links and buttons will dynamically display based on whether there is an authenticated user logged in or not.
Error messages are displayed in any validations fail when updating or creating a course, as well as during user sign up.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
